# Lecture

## Webpack and CSS
Start with a new clone of the [simple react setup](https://github.com/nmadd/simple-react-setup). Then run:
```
npm install
npm install --save-dev css-loader style-loader
```
Add the following line to your App.js file:
```javascript
var css = require("./App.css");
```
Now clear out App.css and add the following line:
```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```
Run `npm start` and your "Hello world" header should be red!

## Webpack and Glyph fonts
The [Get Started](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/) directions for FontAwesome work in our webpack project. You can use this CDN script tag in your index.html:
```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="https://use.fontawesome.com/2af5f3d917.js"></script>
</head>
```
Now we can use any of the [FontAwesome icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) in our app. Try the following in your App.js. Note that we have to use `className`, not just `class` for this to work:
```html
<div>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <i className="fa fa-camera-retro"></i> fa-camera-retro
</div>
```
